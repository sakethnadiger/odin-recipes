    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is an extremely simple recipe to make bread!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>500g strong white flour, plus extra for dusting</li>
        <li>2tsp salt</li>
        <li>7g sachet fast-action yeast</li>
        <li>3tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>300ml water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix 500g strong white flour, 2 tsp salt and a 7g sachet of fast-action yeast in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Make a well in the centre, then add 3 tbsp olive oil and 300ml water, and mix well. If the dough seems a little stiff, add another 1-2 tbsp water and mix well.

        </li>
        <li>Tip onto a lightly floured work surface and knead for around 10 mins.

        </li>
        <li>Once the dough is satin-smooth, place it in a lightly oiled bowl and cover with cling film. Leave to rise for 1 hour until doubled in size or place in the fridge overnight.

        </li>
        <li>Line a baking tray with baking parchment. Knock back the dough (punch the air out and pull the dough in on itself) then gently mould the dough into a ball.

        </li>
        <li>Place it on the baking parchment to prove for a further hour until doubled in size.

        </li>
        <li>Heat oven to 220C/fan 200C/gas 7.

        </li>
        <li>Dust the loaf with some extra flour and cut a cross about 6cm long into the top of the loaf with a sharp knife.

        </li>
        <li>Bake for 25-30 mins until golden brown and the loaf sounds hollow when tapped underneath. Cool on a wire rack.

        </li>
    </ol>
