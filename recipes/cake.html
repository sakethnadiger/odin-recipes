    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is an simple 4-step recipe to create a delicious vanilla cake in no time!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>175g margarine or softened butter</li>
        <li>175g caster sugar</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>175g self-raising flour, sifted</li>
        <li>1tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>pinch of salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oven to 180Â°C (gas mark 4). Lightly grease an 18cm (7in) round cake tin with a little extra butter or margarine and cut a piece of greaseproof paper or non-stick baking parchment to fit the base of the tin.</li>
        <li>Put all the ingredients into a large mixing bowl and beat with a wooden spoon or a hand-held mixer for 1 minute, or until just combined. It's important not to beat the batter too much - just long enough to make it smooth.

        </li>
        <li>Pour or spoon the mixture into the tin, smooth the top and bake on the middle shelf of the oven for about 45-50 minutes. The cake is cooked when it looks well risen and golden; the top should spring back when lightly touched with a fingertip. Another test is to insert a skewer into the centre of the cake - it should come out clean.

        </li>
        <li>Let the cake sit in the tin for 5 minutes, then gently run a knife around the edge and turn it out onto a wire rack to cool. Serve dusted with icing sugar.

        </li>
    </ol>
